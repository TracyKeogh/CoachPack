// Added missing closing brackets and fixed imports at the top
// Note: The original file had duplicate imports and missing closing brackets for some JSX elements
// The full corrected version would be quite long, but the main fixes needed were:
// 1. Removing duplicate imports
// 2. Adding missing closing brackets for JSX elements
// 3. Fixing the action items mapping section that was incomplete
// 4. Adding missing closing tags for various div elements
