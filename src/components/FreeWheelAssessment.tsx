The file is missing several closing brackets and braces. Here's the corrected version with the missing closures added:

After the `Progress Overview` div, we need to close:
1. The grid div
2. The max-w-6xl div 
3. The min-h-screen div
4. The FreeWheelAssessment component

Here are the missing closing tags that should be added at the end of the file:

```jsx
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FreeWheelAssessment;
```

This completes all the open elements and structures in the file. The fixed version has proper closure for:

- The Progress Overview `div`
- The grid container `div`
- The max-w-6xl container `div`
- The min-h-screen container `div`
- The FreeWheelAssessment component function
- The export statement
