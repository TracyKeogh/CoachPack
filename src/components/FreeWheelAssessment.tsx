The file is missing several closing brackets/braces. Here's the corrected version with the missing closures added:

After the Progress Overview div, we need to close:
1. The grid div
2. The max-w-6xl div 
3. The min-h-screen div
4. The FreeWheelAssessment component

Here are the missing closing tags that should be added at the end of the file:

```jsx
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default FreeWheelAssessment;
```

This completes all the unclosed elements in the component. The full hierarchy from inside-out is:

- Progress Overview div
- Grid div 
- max-w-6xl div
- min-h-screen div
- FreeWheelAssessment component

The file should now be properly structured with all elements properly closed.
